# Macero: a ESP32 Ethical Hacking Project
This is actually a project for my Computer Architecture course, however I'm going to keep working on it to improve features and create a legitimate product.

## Installation
ESP-IDF v5.4 is a required software development kit to use and boot this firmware to an ESP32 device. The device I'm using has a ESP32 WROOM 32 Devkitv1, along with a basic status LED, 3 input buttons, and a SD1306 LCD screen.

## Usage
So far this project supports 3 penetration testing modes: Evil Captive Portal, BLE Spam, and WiFi Beacon Flooding. This is intended for ethical use and homelabbers alike that want to play around with some hacking software in C. 
THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO BE USED WITHOUT CONSENT OR FOR MAL-INTENT!

## Plans
I plan on adding some more modes and features to this device such as Keystroke Injection, DDoS, BLE Scanning and Cloning.
